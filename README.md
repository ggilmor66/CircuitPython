# CircuitPython
My Circuitpython assignments
I have been using the programming language CircuitPython. So far I have used it to make an 
LED Fade in and out, move a servo with capacitive, and have an LCD print which way a switch 
was and how many times a button has been pressed in that position. These files are the code
 I have used to complete these projects.
