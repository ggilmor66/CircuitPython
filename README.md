# CircuitPython
My Circuitpython assignments

## Hello Circuit Python
  ### Objective:
    For this assignment, we where supposed to code an LED on a metro Express board, these are new to us this year, to fade in and out. 
  ### Things I learned: 
  I learned about how these new metro boards work. One I first saw them I thought they where going to be the same as Arduinos. Thiough they do similar things as an Arduino, I learned that they run CircuitPython and have this cool LED already built in to the board.
